JEM207 Data Processing in Python, Final Project, 
Onďřej Charvát, Richard Karolík

Our first topic proposal was more related to summary of the surf forecast. However, during the process of scraping of the website
www.magicseaweed.com we ran into troubles. First big trouble was the html code hidden behind java.script, we managed
to overcome this problem, although then there was trouble with not straightforward html structure so we decided to make
our project based on the data from the website www.worldsurfleague.com

Our analysis of the Championship Tour data will take you little bit into the surfing world. We gathered relevant information 
about the contestants from the last season (2019). We developed the class Athlete() that we used for scraping data.

Then we looked at the data and got rid of all outliers, missing values or some mistakes, which could corrupt our analysis.
After initial cleaning, we moved to the visualisation. For the visualisation we used the package Plotly, what we found
very usefull and interactive.

As a last step, we commented on our results and our approach.
